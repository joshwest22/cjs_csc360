Coding Just Sucks - Software Design Group
Christian F., Selam V., Josh W.

This was an academic exercise demonstrating the worst way to write software that technically still works. PLEASE NEVER CODE LIKE THIS!!!

Bad Practices that we implemented:
- Changed names of all variables, methods, and classes to be no longer describe what they actually do
- Added excessive uneccessary comments (except when there were no comments for inconsistency)
- Lack of consistency in names and style
- Placed everything on one line (except when we didn't for inconsistency)
- Added a switch statement that never runs (meant to represent old code that is no longer implemented)
